## Project Description:
Creating an Island Survival prediction application using the Titanic dataset and Streamlit.

## Steps:
1. We created our own random dataset with the help of the following Dataset: [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file).
   * Gender: The gender of the individual (Male or Female)
   * Age: The age of the person.
   * Health: The health condition of the individual (Poor, Good, Excellent).
   * Shelter_Built: A binary variable indicating whether the person has built a shelter (Yes or No).
   * Water_Available: A binary variable indicating whether there is access to water (Yes or No).
   * Food_Available: A binary variable indicating whether there is access to food (Yes or No).
   * Days_Survived: The number of days the person has survived on the island.
   * Survived: A binary variable indicating whether the person has been rescued (Yes or No).
3. Preprocessing the data.
4. Training the model and saving the model for application use.
5. Creating a machine learning web application using Streamlit.
6. Uploading the necessary files in Git Hub and deploying the Streamlt code into the Streamlit cloud.
